# Draw Steel Retainer 

This plugin is designed to be used in conjunction with the TTRPG Draw Steel by MCDM. The plugin allows users to manage and track combat encounters in a initiative tracker. 

## Initiative Tracker
In order to use the initiative tracker, you must simple press the scroll ribbon. This will open a view with the tracker inside of it. The tracker allows for a DM to have two tables for tracking Draw Steel style initiative.
